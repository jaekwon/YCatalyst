DEAD PROJECT
============

  This project is dead. A new web framework for node.js+coffeescript is in the works.

YCatalyst
=========

  YCatalyst is a Hacker News clone written for Node.js in Coffeescript.  
  You can view the original site at http://ycatalyst.com.  

  Please note that this is alpha quality and very much a work in progress.  
  If you would like to contribute, please email me at jkwon.work@gmail.com.

  If you want to check out the real-time features, you can create a test  
  account at our staging server: http://staging.ycatalyst.com:8080/.  
  Use invite-code 'staging'.  

Features
